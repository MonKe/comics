A simple jekyll blog -- I wish to publish pictures regularly instead of being
such a lazy ass.

In the future you will be getting more interesting features:

* an atom feed

* disqus comments (maybe)

* hopefully, I'm gonna switch to [Frankie] (https://github.com/MonKe/frankie),
as soon as it becomes ... stable.
