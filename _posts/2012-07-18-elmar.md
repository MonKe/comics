Elmar was a character I created for a roleplay game *which we did not really
play in the end*. Still it stayed in my mind:

"A cowardly rabbit, chased from home cause his folks didn't like him looking
like a fag. He entertains (himself) with music, steals a bit, and goes on
missions only when the team got tough guys to take care of monsters."
